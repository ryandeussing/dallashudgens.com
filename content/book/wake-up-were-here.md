blurb: In these collected stories of deeply human, flawed men and women in search of connection, consolation and better odds, Dallas Hudgens once again taps into the powerful and resonant view of ordinary lives made less so that has earned him national praise for his novels, Drive Like Hell and Season of Gene.

description: |
  In a Nation's Capital fully occupied by the ninety-nine percent, going about the business of their lives, and in Detroit, Buffalo, Winnipeg, Oxnard and Tampa, life lays down its rhythm in dreams, promises and bills, the truth in neon light through the hazy smoke, and the telltale beat of inconstant hearts, foreclosures, and the everyday rigors of smoking, drinking, working, parenting, cheating, and praying that just one break could make it.

  America, down on her luck, ready for redemption, has never looked closer than this, or more like us.

  copy_markdown: “Hudgens doesn't shy away from the brutality of life on earth -- the illness, the decreptitude, the humiliations and the teen suicides -- but the grittiness is never gratuitous, and his stories are infused with compassion and hope."
